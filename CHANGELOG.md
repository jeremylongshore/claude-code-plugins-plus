## [1.0.38] - 2025-10-15

### 🎯 Release Highlights

**🚀 Marketplace Reliability Hotfix**

Issue [#13](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins/issues/13) showed that our CLI marketplace import failed when extra metadata lived in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. This release restores a frictionless `/plugin marketplace add` experience while keeping the website’s richer data intact.

**What's New:**
- CLI marketplace catalog is now regenerated from an extended source file, stripping unsupported keys (`featured`, `mcpTools`, `pluginCount`, `pricing`, `components`).
- New `npm run sync-marketplace` command (backed by `scripts/sync-marketplace.cjs`) gives maintainers a one-step workflow to refresh the CLI-safe catalog.
- CI guard runs the sync script on every PR, failing fast if someone forgets to regenerate the CLI catalog.

**Migration Note:** Marketplace installs prior to 2025-10-15 still work, but run `/plugin marketplace remove claude-code-plugins` followed by `/plugin marketplace add jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins` to pick up the new `claude-code-plugins-plus` slug and avoid conflicts with Anthropic’s catalog.

---

### 🛒 Marketplace Catalog

- Introduced `.claude-plugin/marketplace.extended.json` as the single source of truth containing all metadata used by the Astro marketplace site.
- Regenerated `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` to be fully schema-compliant with Claude Code CLI, resolving the import failure reported in #13.
- Updated marketplace generators (`marketplace/generate-content.js`, `marketplace/generate-missing-plugins.cjs`) to prefer the extended catalog so featured status, pricing, and component counts stay visible on the website without breaking the CLI.

---

### 🛠️ Tooling & CI

- Added executable `scripts/sync-marketplace.cjs` plus a package script entry so contributors can refresh the CLI catalog with a single command.
- Wired the sync step into `.github/workflows/validate-plugins.yml`; the workflow now blocks merges when `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` is out of sync with the extended catalog.

---

### 📚 Documentation

- Updated README, CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, SETUP.md, and the plugin creation learning path to walk through the new “edit extended catalog → run sync” process.
- Highlighted the sync command in the common development tasks so marketplace updates stay CLI-safe before submission.

### 🔒 Security Infrastructure

#### New Security Policy (SECURITY.md)

**Comprehensive 500+ line security documentation:**

- **Threat Model** - 6 major attack vectors identified and mitigated
- **Plugin Verification Process** - Automated + manual + community review
- **Plugin Trust Levels** - Community → Verified → Featured (3-tier system)
- **Security SLAs** - Response time commitments (24hrs for critical issues)
- **Responsible Disclosure** - Clear vulnerability reporting process

**Threats Addressed:**
1. Prompt Injection Attacks (malicious instructions hijacking Claude)
2. Data Exfiltration (plugins sending user data to external servers)
3. Destructive Operations (rm -rf, data deletion)
4. Dependency Poisoning (malicious npm packages in MCP plugins)
5. Supply Chain Attacks (compromised maintainer accounts)
6. Typosquatting (similar plugin names tricking users)

#### Enhanced GitHub Actions Security Scanning

**4 new automated security steps** in `.github/workflows/validate-plugins.yml`:

**Scan 1 - Hardcoded Secrets Detection:**
- API keys, passwords, tokens (20+ character patterns)
- AWS keys (AKIA pattern detection)
- Private keys (BEGIN PRIVATE KEY)
- **Action**: Fails build if secrets found

**Scan 2 - Dangerous Pattern Detection:**
- Destructive commands (`rm -rf /`)
- Command injection (`eval()`)
- Data exfiltration (curl to IP addresses)
- Obfuscation (base64 decoding)
- **Action**: Fails on critical, warns on suspicious

**Scan 3 - Suspicious URL Detection:**
- Non-HTTPS URLs (except localhost)
- URL shorteners (bit.ly, tinyurl) - phishing risk
- **Action**: Warns for manual review

**Scan 4 - MCP Dependency Scanning:**
- npm audit for all MCP plugins
- Production dependency vulnerability checks
- **Action**: Reports audit results

**Runs on**: Every PR + every push to main

#### Enhanced Pull Request Template

**15+ security checks** added to `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`:

**Automated Checks (8)**:
- No hardcoded secrets, AWS keys, private keys
- No destructive commands, eval(), command injection
- No base64 obfuscation, suspicious URLs
- HTTPS enforcement (except localhost)

**Manual Review (7)**:
- Prompt injection protection
- Data privacy/exfiltration prevention
- Permission audit (minimal necessary)
- Clear intent documentation
- Input validation
- Error handling (no sensitive data exposure)
- Dependency review (MCP plugins)

#### README Security Positioning

- **Security badge** in header badges row
- **Essential Documentation table** with User Security Guide as #1 item
- **Clean, minimalist structure** following release system philosophy
- Security visible but not cluttering above-the-fold

---

### Changed

- **Repository Model**: Pivoted from commercial plugin packs to open-source community marketplace
- **Monetization Strategy**: GitHub Sponsors + consulting/training instead of direct plugin sales
- **Distribution Model**: GitHub-based marketplace catalog (JSON) instead of Gumroad
- **Focus**: Community-driven growth and first-mover advantage

### Removed

- Commercial plugin packs infrastructure (`website/products/`)
- Gumroad sales integration (`website/marketing-site/`)
- Build automation for commercial distribution (`website/scripts/`)
- Internal business reports (`website/000-docs/`)

### Infrastructure

- Marketplace catalog: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with 4 plugins
- Plugin validation CI/CD pipeline
- GitHub Sponsors monetization framework
- Community contribution workflow

### Metrics

- **Production Plugins**: 1 (git-commit-smart)
- **Example Plugins**: 3 (educational)
- **Templates**: 4 (starter templates)
- **Validation Scripts**: 3 (quality assurance)
- **Documentation Pages**: 6+ (comprehensive guides)

### Migration Notes

This release represents a complete pivot from a commercial model to an open-source community marketplace. The restructure was motivated by:

1. **Distribution Reality**: Claude Code plugin marketplace doesn't support commercial sales
2. **Community Value**: Open-source model better serves developer community
3. **First-Mover Advantage**: Launched days after Anthropic's plugin announcement (October 2025)
4. **Sustainable Model**: GitHub Sponsors + consulting provides sustainable revenue

All quality work (validation systems, templates, production plugin) was preserved and migrated to the new structure.
