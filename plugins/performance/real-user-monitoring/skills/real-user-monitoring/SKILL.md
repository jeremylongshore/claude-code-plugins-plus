  This skill assists in implementing Real User Monitoring (RUM) to capture and analyze actual user performance data. It helps set up tracking for key metrics like Core Web Vitals, page load times, and custom performance events. Use this skill when the user asks to "setup RUM", "implement real user monitoring", "track user experience", or needs assistance with "performance monitoring". It guides the user through choosing a RUM platform, designing an instrumentation strategy, and implementing the necessary tracking code.

## Overview

This skill streamlines the process of setting up Real User Monitoring (RUM) for web applications. It guides you through the essential steps of choosing a platform, defining metrics, and implementing the tracking code to capture valuable user experience data.

## How It Works

1. **Platform Selection**: Helps you consider available RUM platforms (e.g., Google Analytics, Datadog RUM, New Relic).
2. **Instrumentation Design**: Guides you in defining the key performance metrics to track, including Core Web Vitals and custom events.
3. **Tracking Code Implementation**: Assists in implementing the necessary JavaScript code to collect and transmit performance data.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Implement Real User Monitoring on a website or web application.
- Track Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) to improve user experience.
- Monitor page load times (FCP, TTI, TTFB) for performance optimization.

## Examples

### Example 1: Setting up RUM for a new website

User request: "setup RUM for my new website"

The skill will:
1. Guide the user through selecting a RUM platform.
2. Provide code snippets for implementing basic tracking.

### Example 2: Tracking custom performance metrics

User request: "I want to track how long it takes users to complete a purchase"

The skill will:
1. Help define a custom performance metric for purchase completion time.
2. Generate JavaScript code to track the metric.

## Best Practices

- **Privacy Compliance**: Ensure compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) when collecting user data.
- **Sampling**: Implement sampling to reduce data volume and impact on performance.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to prevent tracking code from breaking the website.

## Integration

This skill can be used in conjunction with other monitoring and analytics tools to provide a comprehensive view of application performance.
