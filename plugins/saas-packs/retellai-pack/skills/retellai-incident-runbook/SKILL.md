# Retell AI Incident Runbook

## Overview

Implementation patterns for Retell AI incident runbook — voice agent and telephony platform.

## Prerequisites

- Completed `retellai-install-auth` setup

## Instructions

### Step 1: SDK Pattern

```typescript
import Retell from 'retell-sdk';
const retell = new Retell({ apiKey: process.env.RETELL_API_KEY! });

const agents = await retell.agent.list();
console.log(`Agents: ${agents.length}`);
```

## Output

- Retell AI integration for incident runbook

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Invalid API key | Check RETELL_API_KEY |
| 429 Rate Limited | Too many requests | Implement backoff |
| 400 Bad Request | Invalid parameters | Check API documentation |

## Examples

### Contain a spike in failed transfers

When transfer failures cross the alert threshold, freeze new agent promotions
and route new calls to the last known-good agent or human queue. Capture call
identifiers, agent versions, transfer destinations, and response codes without
copying recordings into the incident channel. Compare a synthetic preview call
with the affected production version, make one reversible routing change, and
document the rollback condition before restoring normal traffic.
