# Sponsor Positioning Framework

## The Problem
Anyone can use free plugins, but paying sponsors need recognition for their investment and custom development partnerships.

## User Types & Positioning

### 1. 🆓 Free Users
**Language:** "Using Claude Code Plugins"
**Examples:**
- "Companies using our plugins"
- "Downloaded by teams at..."
- "Adopted by developers from..."

### 2. ⭐ Individual Supporters ($10-50/month)
**Language:** "Community Supporters"
**Examples:**
- "Supporting open-source development"
- "Community backer"
- "Individual sponsor"

### 3. 🏆 Enterprise Sponsors ($199+/month)
**Language:** "Investment Partners"
**Examples:**
- "Investing in custom plugin development"
- "Enterprise development partner"
- "Commissioned custom solutions"
- "Funding ongoing innovation"

### 4. 💎 Custom Development Clients (Project-based)
**Language:** "Strategic Partners"
**Examples:**
- "Commissioned enterprise-grade plugins"
- "Custom development partnership"
- "Proprietary plugin development"

## Key Differentiators to Emphasize

### For Paying Sponsors:
1. **Investment Language**
   - "invests in" vs "uses"
   - "sponsors" vs "adopts"
   - "commissions" vs "downloads"

2. **Exclusivity Indicators**
   - "Custom-built for [Company]"
   - "Proprietary workflows"
   - "Tailored to enterprise needs"

3. **Partnership Status**
   - "Development partner since [date]"
   - "GitHub Sponsor at Enterprise tier"
   - "Strategic technology partner"

4. **Impact Statements**
   - "Funding community development"
   - "Enabling open-source sustainability"
   - "Driving innovation roadmap"
