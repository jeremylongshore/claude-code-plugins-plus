## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions
- **Public repo stays free:** All community plugins remain in public claude-code-plugins-plus repo
- **Private repo for premium:** Premium plugins will live in claude-code-marketplace repo (Q1 2025)
- **Dual catalog system:** marketplace.extended.json (source) → marketplace.json (generated)

### Pricing Decisions
- **Supporter ($5/mo):** Entry-level tier for individual devs
- **Pro ($19/mo):** Sweet spot for professional devs (10x value proposition)
- **Enterprise ($199/mo):** Custom development tier for companies
- **DiagnosticPro reference:** Corrected to $4.99 (not $29.99)

### Feature Decisions
- **Start with web-to-github-issue:** Flagship free plugin shows value
- **4 premium plugins planned:** Balanced roadmap across tiers
- **Q1 2025 timeline:** Realistic development schedule
- **Discord community:** Central to sponsor engagement

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Mega prompt integration:** Clear requirements led to fast implementation
2. **Validation suite:** Caught issues early (description length, frontmatter)
3. **Comprehensive documentation:** Launch materials save hours later
4. **Version bumping:** Clear progression (1.0.40 → 1.0.41 → 1.0.42)

### What to Improve
1. **Website theming:** Need to use intentsolutions.io Astro theme (per user request)
2. **Discord setup:** Should have been automated in this release
3. **Private repo:** Set up claude-code-marketplace earlier for cleaner rollout

### User Feedback Integrated
- ✅ DiagnosticPro pricing corrected ($4.99)
- ✅ Use intentsolutions.io Astro theme
- ✅ "keep going dont stop" - continuous implementation
- ✅ Revenue strategy across all products
